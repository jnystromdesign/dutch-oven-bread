# Dutch oven bread 
Recipe for bread baked in Dutch oven.

## Act 1: _Make the doughl_
1. Mix ½ package of yeast with 0.5dl of water which has been heated to 37 °C. Make sure the yeast spreads out.
2. Add 4dl of 37 ℃ water to the yeast and whisk in 1dl of flour. Let the mixture take it easy while you watch an episode of Adventure Time.
3. Add 0.5dl of olive oil and ½ tablespoon of salt without iodine (It's possible _with_ iodine but it's better without. Iodine kills).
4. Slowly add flour to the mixture until your have a dough. Stop once the dough begins to release from the edges of the bowl (Sorry, I can’t be more specific than that. Flour is hard to measure).
5. Cover with cling film and let the dough chillax in the fridge overnight.

## Act 2: _Time to wake up, little friend_
>It’s the morning and it’s early. The kids want to watch Bolibompa but Women's Prison isn’t finished yet

1. Remove the dough from the fridge and place it on a well floured surface. _Fold_ the dough like an envelope multiple times, adding extra flour so the texture becomes firm. The dough should reform after you poke it with a finger. Dust a chopping board with flour and place the dough on it.
2. Make some coffee. Put the kids in front of Bolibompa. Explain that the bread isn’t ready yet. 
3. Pre-heat the oven to approximately 250 °C. Place an iron pot, including it’s lid, in the oven.
4. After 30-45 minutes remove the pot, take off the lid and add a small amount of polenta (the type where the corn does something sånt där majsjox spanjorer äter), alternatively a small amount of flour (which will most likely work just as well). 

## Act 3: _This is for your own good_
1. Check out how gorgeous your dough looks! Using a sharp knife, cut a few cuts along the bread surface. Don’t be scared, it’s for the breads own good.
2. Scrap the bread from the chopping board into the pot(help it with a spachelor). It's going to look silly. You are going to think that something has gone wrong. It hasn't. 
3. Put the lid back on the pot and place all the goodness in the oven for 30 minutes
4. Open the oven. Remove the lid and give the bread 10 more minutes. Your might think that the surface will be too hard. It won’t be. 
5. Remove the pot from the over. Remove the bread from the pan and place on a rest. 
6. Say goodbye to the bread. Travel to work. Think about the bread. 
7. Travel home. Say hello to the bread. Eat the bread.
8. Enjoy...
